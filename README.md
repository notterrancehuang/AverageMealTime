# AverageMealTime

## Summary
Database to track user's start and end time of eating a meal. Over time, it will give you an average of the duration of your meal times. 
User can filter by searching database with tags. For example, filtering by "dinner" and "date night" has an average duration of 1 hr 30. 

## Why I created this
I wanted to more accurately plan for meals on my calendar. Too many times have I underestimated how long I would take for eating, and that carves into my following calendar events.
